# PovertyPulse Native JS Analytics (2015-2025)

A high-performance Data Analytics platform built entirely with **TypeScript** and **React**. This project uses client-side statistical modeling and the Google Gemini API to visualize and analyze poverty trends in India.

## Tech Stack
- **Compute Engine**: Native TypeScript / V8
- **Visualization**: Recharts, D3-Geo
- **Grounding**: Gemini API (Google Search Tooling)
- **UI Framework**: React 19, Tailwind CSS

## Features
- **Zero Latency**: All statistical calculations (Variance, StdDev, Mean) are performed natively in the browser.
- **Dynamic Choropleth**: State-level poverty heatmap powered by D3 projections.
- **AI-Driven Grounding**: Real-time retrieval of NITI Aayog and MoSPI documents.
- **Comprehensive Export**: PDF, CSV, and Excel reporting generated client-side.

## Native Implementation
This project replaces traditional Python-based analysis (Pandas/NumPy) with a high-performance TypeScript compute pipeline, allowing for real-time reactivity and immediate state-management synchronization.
